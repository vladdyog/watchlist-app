# CueMovie

A web app that helps you pick a random movie from your watchlist.

Upload the CSV export from your **IMDb** or **Letterboxd** account, and the app enriches your list with data from TMDb - then picks a random movie for you.

Your list is saved in the browser, so it's still there next time you open it!

## Features

- Upload a watchlist CSV from IMDb or Letterboxd.
- Automatically enriches movies with ratings, genres, runtime, posters, and overviews via the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
- Filter your list by rating, runtime, release year, genre, and date added.
- Pick a random movie from your filtered list.
- **Deck mode** - queue up multiple picks and shuffle them to choose a winner.
- Click any result to open a detail modal with poster and overview.
- Export your updated list back as a CSV.
- Submit feedback directly from the app - bug reports, feature ideas, or general comments and questions.
- Persists your list in the browser (no account or server needed).

## Supported CSV Formats

| Source     | How to export                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| IMDb       | Profile → Watchlist → Export           |
| Letterboxd | Profile → Watchlist → Export Watchlist |

**Note:** IMDb allows exporting any list you own, not just your watchlist.

Other CSV files may also work if they have a `Title`/`Name` and `Year` column (TMDb enrichment will still be attempted).

## How It Works

1. **Upload** - Select a CSV file exported from IMDb or Letterboxd
2. **Enrich** - The app fetches metadata for each movie from TMDb (rating, genres, runtime, poster, overview)
3. **Filter** - Narrow your list by rating, runtime, release year, genre, or date added
4. **Pick** - Click "Pick a film" to get a random movie from your filtered list
5. **Deck mode** - Optionally queue multiple picks and run a shuffle to crown a winner
6. **Export** - Download your updated list as a CSV
7. **Persist** - Your enriched list is saved in localStorage so it survives page refreshes

To load a new list, simply upload a new CSV - it replaces the previous one.
